# LeetMetrics-LeetCode-Progress-Tracker
Built a web app to track LeetCode user progress including total submissions and problems solved by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard). Used a CORS proxy to fetch real-time data securely from LeetCodeâ€™s GraphQL API. Designed a clean, responsive UI to provide users with quick and insightful competitive programming stats.
